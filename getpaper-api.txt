New notes for the new ADS, including API access

To make an account and get an authorization key, see https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api

Now my token is RRRRRRR#rRRRRR###########3#########R###R# (redacted)

It suggests to access like
  curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer:RRRRRRR#rRRRRR###########3#########R###R#' 'https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/query?q=star&fl=bibcode'

Now to get a line for resolving bibcode

In the old getpaper using the classic ADS, getpaper's ADSURL looks like

  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?version=1&warnings=YES&partial_bibcd=YES&sort=BIBCODE&db_key=ALL&bibstem=$JCODE&volume=$VOLUME&page=$PAGE&nr_to_return=1&start

Here I made a search on the new ADS UI for ApJ 878 156

  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=bibstem%3AApJ%20volume%3A878%20page%3A156&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0

  Let's disect this.
  %3A is colon ':'
  %20 is space ' '

Now I try to mash this together

curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer:RRRRRRR#rRRRRR###########3#########R###R#' 'https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/query?q=bibstem%3AApJ%20volume%3A878%20page%3A156&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0'

With a little modification, I can grab the bibcode:

Nominally (from memory) I am fetching the bibcode, then the bibtex file, the abstract, and eventually the URL for the publisher's link to the paper.
  I should be careful for the rate limits to fetch in one go rather than 4 unique calls, since the number of queries are limited to 5000 a day

Not clear how to get multiple returns, but here is one for the abstract

To interpret these observations, we need to calculate the evolution of radioactive-to-stable isotopic ratios in the Galaxy. We present an extension of the open-source galactic chemical evolution codes NuPyCEE and JINAPyCEE that enable the decay of radioactive isotopes in the interstellar medium to be tracked. We show how the evolution of the isotopic ratio depends on the star formation history and efficiency, star-to-gas mass ratio, and galactic outflows. Given the uncertainties in the observations used to calibrate our model, our predictions for isotopic ratios at the time of formation of the Sun are uncertain by a factor of 3.6. At that time, to recover the actual radioactive-to-stable isotopic ratios predicted by our model, one can multiply the steady-state solution (see Equation (1)) by {2.3}<SUB>-0.7</SUB><SUP>+3.4</SUP>. However, in the cases where the radioactive isotope has a half-life longer than ∼200 Myr, or the target radioactive or stable isotopes have mass- and/or metallicity-dependent production rates, or they originate from different sources with different delay-time distributions, or the reference isotope is radioactive, our codes should be used for more accurate solutions. Our preliminary calculations confirm the dichotomy between radioactive nuclei in the early solar system with r- and s-process origin, and that <SUP>55</SUP>Mn and <SUP>60</SUP>Fe can be explained by galactic chemical evolution, while <SUP>26</SUP>Al cannot."}]}}
