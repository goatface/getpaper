Full port of project from http://www.cns.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~daid/hack/getpaper.html including version history.

Documentation and new versions forthcoming ... i.e. the whole reason I'm doing this project, so I can track the improvements in the last 2 years (which have been extremely significant).  RSN!

In the mean time, see https://github.com/goatface/scripts which is a more recent version.
